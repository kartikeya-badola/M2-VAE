# M2-VAE
PyTorch Implementation of Kingma's M2 VAE

Kingma, D.P., Mohamed, S., Rezende, D.J. and Welling, M., 2014. Semi-supervised learning with deep generative models. In Advances in neural information processing systems (pp. 3581-3589).

My implementation of the probabilistic graphical model presented in the above paper. Implemented in PyTorch, trained on MNIST.

# Generations

![generation](https://github.com/kartikeya-badola/M2-VAE/blob/master/classwise_generations.png)

Class-wise generations after only 10 epochs of training. Standard deviation matrix was varied from left to right.
